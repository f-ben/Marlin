# Bens Cura-Profiles

This folder contains the Cura-Profiles I am using for my PLA prints. The number at the beginning of the filename defines the quality (with 0 being the best). The special profile is a bit different because in theory it uses worse quality settings than the super profile but in reality the difference is negligable. However the special profile prints almost twice as fast as the super.
