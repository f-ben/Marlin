#### Disclaimer: Use this firmware at your own risk. I do not take responsibility for any damage caused to you and/or your printer.

This folder contains the precompiled firmware.bin file to flash the Ender 3 with the SKR E3 Mini v2. This is probably the fastest way to get good print results with your printer. The firmware includes all features listed on the main page except BLTouch.

To flash the printer simply put the file on the root of the SD-Card, put it into your printer and power it on. The first boot takes a few seconds longer because it will flash the firmware to your printer. After flashing you should calibrate your printer and hot end.
